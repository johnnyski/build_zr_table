CHANGES for build_zr_table
===========================

v1.14  (09/08/2003)
-------------------------
1. Fixed leap year bug in subroutine mmddyyyy_to_julian in gauge_radar_accum.pl.
2. Appended "$(EXEEXT)" to target for gauge_gui.pl in Makefile.am to fix a
   problem related to automake target generation and EXEcutable EXTensions.
   See Automake in GNU Manuals Online (www.gnu.org) for details.
3. Updated configure.in for autoconf 2.53.

v1.13  (07/20/2001)
-------------------------
1. Second cappi range corrected to 99 km (was 96) in gauge_qc.pl,
   gauge_radar_accum.pl, and gauge_radar_nonzero.pl.
2. ZR table indexing problem corrected in zr.c.
   The above problems were discovered and corrected by Dave Marks
   and Dave Silberstein.

  03/28/00
-------------------------
1.
   Daylight savings time problem.
   Modified build_dual_zr.c
            build_single_zr.c
            build_zr_histo.c
            build_zr_table.c
            zr.c
            zr_utils.c
   In all of the above, set tm.tm_isdst = -1 rather than 0




v1.12  (02/08/2000)
--------------------------
1. It turns out that sgi, at least, doesn't have setenv.
   So, use putenv instead.


v1.11  (02/07/2000)
--------------------------
1. Definate fix for the day light savings time.  All
   time calculations are UTC.

v1.10  (02/04/2000)
--------------------------
1. zr_utils.c had routines that are in zr.h -- removed them.
2. Possible fix to the daylight savings time bug.  I removed any 
   conversion for daylight savings time.

v1.9  (01/21/2000)
--------------------------
1. Fix the name of the main window.

v1.8  (01/19/2000)
--------------------------
1. Fix the dbz/mm labeling problem.
2. Check that a network is selected when setting options prior to any plotting.

v1.7  (01/19/2000)
--------------------------
1. Interface mods.
2. Fix -- saving config.

v1.6  (01/11/2000)
--------------------------
1. Bug fixes.
2. Face lift for gauge_gui_main.pl

v1.5  (12/21/1999)
--------------------------
1. File eyalqc.f
   a. Includes option to adjust range for gauge QC.
   b. Gauges outside of valid range are labelled as bad
      so that gauge_radar_accum.pl will not accumulate
      from these gauges.
   b. R/G bias test normalization calculation includes
      only those gauges which pass the other three criteria.
   c. Accumulation statistics from radar and gauge networks 
      are printed when verbose flag is selected.
   d. Increased array dimension for rrate and line -- the
      parsing routine, to deal with uncommonly long second intermediate
      lines.
   e. Includes option to always use majority rule for center
      pixel reflectivity classification.
   f. Increased parameter for number of valid scans.

2. build_zr_table.c
   Added options: --maxdbz, --badval_above_max, --minrange, --maxrange

3. Usage and doc changes.

4. Uses configure.

v1.4 (5/13/1999)
--------------------------
1. Valid range for data in ZR table is 15 to 150km.  Hard coded.
2. Does not accumulate gauge values when == -501.00.  Defined as missing data.


v1.3 (4/29/1999)
--------------------------
1. File gauge_radar_accum.pl.
   a. UPPER case the raintype when reclassified.
   b. When gauge is all 0, still accumulate the radar.
   c. Save dBz for radar when reclassification occurs.
   d. Changed default gauge averaging to 7 minutes (+/- 3.5 min).

v1.2 (4/19/1999)
--------------------------
1. 'automatic_qc.pl' takes --positive-only option.
2. 'eyalqc.f' changes the default to use negative gauge values.
   See -p.
3. 'gauge_radar_accum.pl' changes default to use negative.  See
   --positive-only option.
4. 'gauge_radar_accum.pl' added -center-only option.  This turns off
   the majority rule reclassification of the center point.
5. Fixed the -n bug in gauge_radar_accum.pl (accidently introduced 
   between v0.28 and v1.0).  The option is now called --positive-only.
6. Changed -n to -p for gauge_qc.pl.
7. Changed -n to -p for gauge_radar_plot_batch.pl.
8. Changed -n to -p for gauge_radar_plot_filter.pl.

v1.1 (02/25/1999)
--------------------------
1. Port to SGI. Really only needed the getopt code from GNU C library.

v1.0 (02/17/1999)
--------------------------
1. Created build_zr_table.c, modeled after build_dual_zr_table.c, 
   which has command line interface to constucting the ZR table.

2. Created r_over_g.pl.  This computes R/G for Stratiform and Convective.
   Output can be the total only.  Sorting is NOT necessary, but, 
   gauge_radar_accum.pl IS necessary.

3. Fully automated the ZR generation.  Automated from the 2-nd intermediate
   file through ZR generation.

4. The graphical and batch programs compute R/G.

v0.28 (01/20/1999)
--------------------------
1. Makefile mods: include -lm.
2. Doc updates.

v0.27 - (01/13/1999)
--------------------------
1. Documentation updates.
2. F77 compliant for eyalqc.f

v0.26 - (12/23/98)
--------------------------
1. Integrated Eyal's gauge QC program (eyalqc.f) as the primary
   gauge quality control software.  Previous test versions have
   been removed (See v0.25 and earlier for those earlier versions).

2. Sorting uses the current directory for temporary files.

3. Removed:
       automated_single_event.pl
       automatic_single_match.pl
       automatic_contig_match.pl

4. Renamed build_zr_table to build_pmm_zr_table.  That's more
   descriptive of its function.

5. Added build_{dual,single}_zr.c code, taken from gvs/src/2A-53/ver4,
   and the zr.c and zr_table.h files.

6. Documentation modifications.

7. Sorting, now, by date, time, network then gauge.

v0.25 - beta (10/23/98)
--------------------------
1. Added automatic_qc.pl -- Automatic quality control of gauges.
   This introduced several support programs:

       make_gauge_filter_file.pl

2. Uses the 3km cappi when data is beyond 96km (about 100km).

3. v0.23, v0.24 were not official releases.

4. Sped up gauge_filter.pl to handle very large filter files; the result
   of automatic qc.

v0.22 - beta (8/28/98)
